                        In fact, his maths became so advanced that his teacher ran out of suitable lessons, suggesting he played with "a thing called a personal computer" instead.

                        On this teacher's advice, his parents took out a home loan to buy him his very own personal computer - worth about $5,000 (Â£3,200) in today's money - which from their point of view was aimed at helping him become a doctor.

                        But some work, organised by the same teacher, changed the direction of his life permanently. The teacher suggested to a friend - an accountant at investment bank Merrill Lynch - that Mr Saito, who at the time was just 10-years-old, could help with writing computer programmes.

                        Despite his precocious start, Mr Saito denies that he was hot-housed, saying his parents exposed him to lots of different activities, and made it clear that success was about more than just good grades.

                        In particular, he says both the schools he went to, and his parents, emphasised the importance of volunteering.

                        It's a lesson he has taken to heart, and since the successful sale of his first firm, he has worked hard to support other would-be entrepreneurs.

                        He confesses one of his favourite pursuits, is judging business plans, and he travels globally to do this. To date, he calculates he's judged some 15,000 people in such competitions.

                        But his main focus is his parents' home country of Japan.

                        But his main drive is to make the Japanese more entrepreneurial.
